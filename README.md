# DAC-Papers-Collection
>  A personal collection and evaluation of recent decade's DAC papers.

My research interests include **high-level synthesis**, **neural network compilation** and **architecture design for deep learning**. In order to construct a systematic view of these research fields, as well as learning fresh ideas. I am collecting and sorting DAC (Design Automation Conference) papers by publishing year and those above mentioned research topics.
